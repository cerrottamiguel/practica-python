Hi, my name is Miguel Ignacio Cerrotta, im from Mar del Plata Argentina and im aplying for the Virtual Executive Assistant for Us based companies position. My profesional experience relevant for this position are related to customer service, acounting, and bureaucracy procedures and formalities, specially in the local jurisdiction. All of this skills i apply on the daily basis for my current job position as a notary office employee. The reasons im looking to work for us based companies are. first) my actual job is a part time job and im actually looking for a full time job (doesnt matter the time zone) and second) the exchange rate in argentina makes incomes in dollars here worth more than local currency salaries for a similar job position. So in the end im looking to make my work count and take a step forward in the search for better living conditions. Thank you for your time, and ill be looking formward to your response. good bye
